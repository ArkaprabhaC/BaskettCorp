This [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) tool allows you to monitor server health checks such as database, redis, diskspace, elasticsearch, etc. It depends on the [Spatie Server Monitor library](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-server-monitor).

## Quick Installation
You can install this tool into a Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:

```bash
composer require insenseanalytics/nova-server-monitor
```

Next, if you do not have package discovery enabled, you need to register the provider in the `config/app.php` file:
```php
'providers' => [
    ...,
    Insenseanalytics\NovaServerMonitor\ToolServiceProvider::class,
]
```

Finally, register the tool in your `NovaServiceProvider.php` file:
```php
public function tools()
{
  \Insenseanalytics\NovaServerMonitor\NovaServerMonitor::make()
    ->onConnection('server_monitor')->hosts(['example1.com'])
    ->checks(['mysql']),
}
```

Specify your database connection using the `onConnection` method. Typically the server that monitors your app's checks would be a separate app, and we would make a separate connection in `config/database.php` that connects to the monitoring server's database. If you want to display all checks and hosts, you do not need to call the `hosts` and `checks` methods.
